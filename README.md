Ammunition Crafting Tools is a mod for [The Long Dark](https://www.thelongdark.com). 
A video game developed by [Hinterland Games](https://hinterlandgames.com/).


- Adds Niter and Sulfur to stone spawns in caves, which can be processed into gunpowder ingredients. Adds lead pipes to increase the amount of available lead, found in industrial sites and rarely in other locations. Adds Ammunition Tools, which can speed up the process of making bullets.
- Ammunition crafting tools now requires Quality Tools OR Ammunition Tools. Rifle Bullets are a separate recipe from Revolver Bullets.
- Noisemakers can be crafted anywhere and available from the start. Gunpowder can be crafted at any Work Bench. Both type of Bullets can be crafted at a Forge, but it's more time-consuming and less efficient than using the Ammunition Work Bench.
- Adds the ability to sharpen/repair manufactured arrows using whetstones.
- Through Mod Settings, the spawn chance for Niter and Sulfur can be altered, the textures for ammunition boxes and revolver bullets can be changed to a custom-made one, and the ability to sharpen Manufactured Arrows can be disabled.
